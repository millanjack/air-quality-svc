/*
 * Explanation:
 *
 * Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor() returns an ExecutorService that:
 * - Creates a new virtual thread for every task.
 * - Is ideal for concurrent I/O-bound tasks (e.g., HTTP calls, database queries).
 *
 * Virtual threads are lightweight and scale well compared to platform (OS) threads.
 *
 * shutdown() is still valid — this executor also needs to be shut down to clean up thread factories.
